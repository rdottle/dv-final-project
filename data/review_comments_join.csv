"1",8880999,"Stephanie","We had a great time at Jasmin's place. The apartment is very clean, quiet and well located in Brushwick, a hipster neighbourhood in Brooklyn. We met Jasmin at the very end of our stay, a nice and welcoming guy. Would recommend it for sure!","hipster",-73.9336448314739,40.6988271296597,8880999,"Bushwick South","BK78","Brooklyn","047"
"2",15828883,"Andrew","Tim was great and his place is certainly on the ""rad"" side.  It's the epitome of NY living in the very hipster-sh area of Williamsburg. 

Clean, spacious and easy to get in and out.  If you're staying in Williamsburg and want to be close to some great places, this is your spot.","hipster",-73.9672049812511,40.7101143757288,15828883,"North Side-South Side","BK73","Brooklyn","047"
"3",15563361,"Pendry & Zack","This place is fantastic. It feels like coming home, or starting at a friend's place while they're out of town. 

The location is perfect, and somehow the apartment is quiet. Food and drink are super close; there's even an awesome hipster doughnut place right across the street. 

Easily my favorite airbnb ever.","hipster",-73.974381262142,40.6787940185259,15563361,"Prospect Heights","BK64","Brooklyn","047"
"4",7744805,"Luis","A great value in a great location! This airbnb is conveniently located right around the block from the 125th St. subway stop in Harlem, so getting to and from midtown was only a quick 20 min ride. The neighborhood was a great pick for NY. It is located in a quieter residential street lined with beautiful historic brownstones while around the corner there are plenty of dining and shopping opportunities. It is also very close to the 2 & 3 subway so getting around the city was very convenient. 

Communicating with our hosts was a pinch, they were very easy to reach and more than happy to help us with any of our needs. When we arrived in NY I simply texted our host and she was awaiting us outside the front door of our airbnb for check-in. Overall, our hosts were very helpful, for example letting us check-in early and allowing us to have a package delivered to the apartment during our stay. And when we had a minor issue with the gas stove, they arrived within minutes of our text.

The apartment is spacious, clean and modern and was the perfect choice for my group of friends and I during our extended weekend stay in NY. The living room and kitchen are large for NY standards, and having your own garden/backyard during the stay was an extremely nice touch. However, one should be aware the second bathroom in the master bedroom is kind of awkward to use because it is literally a shower built right into the bedroom, separated only by a curtain. And with high shower curb and narrow shower space, I mostly ended up using the shower in the one shared bathroom in the apartment located off the living room.

The apartment came with a large living room, fully working kitchen, two bathrooms, wifi, a master bedroom with a queen sized bed, and second bedroom with a twin sized bed on the ground and a queen sized bunkbed located above it. The backyard and garden can be accessed through the master bedroom. 

To enter the master bedroom one must go through a door located in the second bedroom, so privacy could be better but I was staying with a group of close friends for a fun weekend so it was not an issue for my group. 

Overall our stay in the apartment was much more than I expected and any negatives were far outweighed by the positives of the place. In sum I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone looking to stay in NY who is looking for a quieter neighborhood or a larger place with a garden and I hope to stay at this place in the future.","historic",-73.9419632927281,40.8073904704598,7744805,"Central Harlem North-Polo Grounds","MN03","Manhattan","061"

"6",6422511,"Judi","Our family of 4 wanted a New York neighborhood experience when we visited NYC for a wedding.   We stayed at My Little Guest Apartment and it was just what we were looking for!   The location was great!   There was nearby street parking, it was easy to get to the #7 train, and it was enjoyable just to walk around the neighborhood and check out the temples, Chinatown and historical buildings.  The beds were comfortable, and there was just enough kitchen so that we could eat some meals there rather than eat out.  Linda and Robert were responsive to our questions and requests as we traveled and while we were there.  We all wished we could have stayed longer!","historic",-73.8178532057937,40.7534834017339,6422511,"East Flushing","QN52","Queens","081"

"8",1074155,"Siobhan","Nancy was very lovely, and made us feel very welcome, however my friend and I decided to leave early to stay somewhere a bit closer to the action, as we found it a little bit too far away from everything, and we wanted a bit more space, as Nancy's accommodation is more suited to a single traveler.
The neighborhood was diverse and multicultural, with nice places to eat that were cheaper than what you would find closer to touristy attractions. Although I felt just slightly unsafe walking around on my own in the evenings. 
Nancy's accommodation would suit a single traveller who doesn't mind discussing the benefits of veganism. If you are not vegan or vegetarian you may have difficulty feeling completely at home, as no food is allowed to be brought into the house. 
Overall though, Nancy was very lovely and welcoming, and a stay with her would be fine if you were ok with the distance to major attractions and with the vegan household rules.","diverse",-73.9322327246352,40.7979355142064,1074155,"East Harlem North","MN34","Manhattan","061"

"10",4346952,"Charlotte","The cozy brownstone room is exactly what it says: a cozy (think: small, with just enough room for a bed and a dressoir) brownstone (in a residential area, with a Nostrand Ave with lots of stores only a few blocks away) room. The common rooms are really welcoming, and the kitchen looked very useable (I didn't use it during my stay). The bathroom is small as well, but the shower is a good one!","cozy",-73.9435754879898,40.6779231048948,4346952,"Crown Heights North","BK61","Brooklyn","047"
"11",658294,"Jill","We enjoyed staying at Tatiana's cozy flat in Chelsea.  She's a very accommodating and gracious hostess.  The apartment is small but has everything you need.  Sure beats staying at an hotel.  Also the neighborhood is a gem.","cozy",-73.995027007414,40.7410729509023,658294,"Hudson Yards-Chelsea-Flatiron-Union Square","MN13","Manhattan","061"
"12",713538,"Elizabeth","Pros: Very cozy, incredibly charming garden unit with lots of original detail (built ins with antique wavy glass and stacks of old novels to read!)  It truly felt that you were staying in someone's home. I enjoyed the residential neighborhood. Clear instructions on how to get in and out. I did not need to contact the owners during my stay, but beforehand they responded very quickly. 
Comfy but firm bed, very dark and pretty quiet at night so easy to sleep in! Comfortable futon-sofa would probably make a great bed as well. Big spare cupboard with extra linens and towels was nice when I needed an extra quilt on the bed for warmth. 

Cons: Unit was very clean (walked around barefoot!) but the towels didn't feel super fresh (maybe in cupboard too long?) and pillows/shower curtain liner need replacing - while those are harsh critiques, they definitely weren't extremes or dirty in any way. Updating those small details would make this an A+. 
I will return.","cozy",-73.96059548163,40.6834053498508,713538,"Clinton Hill","BK69","Brooklyn","047"

The apartment is in a great part of town with Bloomingdales and the Roosevelt Island tramway on the doorstep. 

I would also recommend that you pop into The Jeffrey Craft Beer & Bites 311 E 60th St while you're there. 

I would draw your attention to two things. Firstly, it is a one story walkup. Secondly, the apartment is across the street from the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge entrance so there is a constant flow of traffic.  We stayed two nights. For some reason, the first night (Friday) was very noisy, in particular, the blowing of truck horns coupled with homeless people shouting in the park in front all night. The second night (Saturday) was quieter. I would recommend packing earplugs.

Bo communicated openly and quickly and was great to deal with.","luxury",-73.963816401937,40.7620513192599,7457099,"Lenox Hill-Roosevelt Island","MN31","Manhattan","061"

The amenities of the apartment are perfect for an individual or couple travelling Manhattan.  The apartment has a large screen tv and very fast unlimited internet, which I found very helpful to research all the great places to eat and drink in the area.

I can happily say this is one of the  best organised, accurate and receptive hosts I've had the pleasure of staying with. Especially with the help from Bonds associate  Sergio, who met me at the apartment when i arrived.
